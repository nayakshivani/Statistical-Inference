# Part 1: Simulation Exercise

# Overview: This part is going to execute simulations and data analysises to illustrate application of the central limit theorem. R programming will be the major tool to realize the mentioned goal.




## Question 1: Show the sample mean and compare it to the theoretical mean of the distribution.



knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
lambda <- 0.2
simData <- matrix(rexp(1000*40, lambda), nrow = 1000, ncol = 40)
distMean <- apply(simData, 1, mean)
hist(distMean, breaks = 50, main = "The distribution of 1000 averages of 40 random exponentials", xlab = "Value of means", ylab = "Frequency of means", col = "pink")
abline(v = 1/lambda, lty = 1, lwd = 5, col = "red")
legend("topright", lty = 1, lwd = 5, col = "red", legend = "theoretical mean")

#The simulated sample means are normally distributed with a center very close to the theoretical mean.






## Question 2: Show how variable the sample is (via variance) and compare it to the theoretical variance of the distribution.





distVar <- apply(simData, 1, var)
hist(distVar, breaks = 50, main = "The distribution of 1000 variance of 40 random exponentials", xlab = "Value of variances", ylab = "Frequency of variance", col = "light blue")
abline(v = (1/lambda)^2, lty = 1, lwd = 5, col = "blue")
legend("topright", lty = 1, lwd = 5, col = "blue", legend = "theoretical variance")




#The simulated sample variances are almost normally distributed with a center near the theoretical variance.







## Question 3: Show that the distribution is approximately normal.






par(mfrow = c(3, 1))
hist(simData, breaks = 50, main = "Distribution of exponentials with lambda equals to 0.2", xlab = "Exponentials", col = "yellow")
hist(distMean, breaks = 50, main = "The distribution of 1000 averages of 40 random exponentials", xlab = "Value of means", ylab = "Frequency of means", col = "pink")
simNorm <- rnorm(1000, mean = mean(distMean), sd = sd(distMean))
hist(simNorm, breaks = 50, main = "A normal distribution with theoretical mean and sd of the exponentials", xlab = "Normal variables", col = "light green")




### Results





#### 1. The first histogram is the distribution of the exponentials with lambda equals to 0.2. The second histogram is the distribution of 1000 averages of 40 random exponentials


#### 2. The third histogram is a real normal distribution with a mean and standard deviation equals to the second histogramâ€™s.


#### 3. Comparing the first with the second histogram, we can see the distrubution becames normal as the means were taken from each groups. 


#### 4. It is a result of the central limit theorem. 



#### 5. Comparing the second and the third histogram, we can see the distribution of the means is similar to a real normal distribution with the same mean and standard deviation.
